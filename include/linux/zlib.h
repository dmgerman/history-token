multiline_comment|/* &n;     The &squot;zlib&squot; compression library provides in-memory compression and&n;  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed&n;  data.  This version of the library supports only one compression method&n;  (deflation) but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same&n;  stream interface.&n;&n;     Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large&n;  enough (for example if an input file is mmap&squot;ed), or can be done by&n;  repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter case, the&n;  application must provide more input and/or consume the output&n;  (providing more output space) before each call.&n;&n;     The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format&n;  with an interface similar to that of stdio.&n;&n;     The library does not install any signal handler. The decoder checks&n;  the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never&n;  crash even in case of corrupted input.&n;*/

It may introduce some&n;  output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when&n;  forced to flush.&n;&n;    The detailed semantics are as follows. deflate performs one or both of the&n;  following actions:&n;&n;  - Compress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in&n;    accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not&n;    enough room in the output buffer), next_in and avail_in are updated and&n;    processing will resume at this point for the next call of deflate().&n;&n;  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out&n;    accordingly. This action is forced if the parameter flush is non zero.&n;    Forcing flush frequently degrades the compression ratio, so this parameter&n;    should be set only when necessary (in interactive applications).&n;    Some output may be provided even if flush is not set.&n;&n;  Before the call of deflate(), the application should ensure that at least&n;  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming&n;  more output, and updating avail_in or avail_out accordingly; avail_out&n;  should never be zero before the call. The application can consume the&n;  compressed output when it wants, for example when the output buffer is full&n;  (avail_out == 0), or after each call of deflate(). If deflate returns Z_OK&n;  and with zero avail_out, it must be called again after making room in the&n;  output buffer because there might be more output pending.&n;&n;    If the parameter flush is set to Z_SYNC_FLUSH, all pending output is&n;  flushed to the output buffer and the output is aligned on a byte boundary, so&n;  that the decompressor can get all input data available so far. (In particular&n;  avail_in is zero after the call if enough output space has been provided&n;  before the call.)  Flushing may degrade compression for some compression&n;  algorithms and so it should be used only when necessary.&n;&n;    If flush is set to Z_FULL_FLUSH, all output is flushed as with&n;  Z_SYNC_FLUSH, and the compression state is reset so that decompression can&n;  restart from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if&n;  random access is desired. Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often can seriously degrade&n;  the compression.&n;&n;    If deflate returns with avail_out == 0, this function must be called again&n;  with the same value of the flush parameter and more output space (updated&n;  avail_out), until the flush is complete (deflate returns with non-zero&n;  avail_out).&n;&n;    If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed,&n;  pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there&n;  was enough output space; if deflate returns with Z_OK, this function must be&n;  called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no&n;  more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an error. After&n;  deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations on the&n;  stream are deflateReset or deflateEnd.&n;  &n;    Z_FINISH can be used immediately after deflateInit if all the compression&n;  is to be done in a single step. In this case, avail_out must be at least&n;  0.1% larger than avail_in plus 12 bytes.  If deflate does not return&n;  Z_STREAM_END, then it must be called again as described above.&n;&n;    deflate() sets strm-&gt;adler to the adler32 checksum of all input read&n;  so far (that is, total_in bytes).&n;&n;    deflate() may update data_type if it can make a good guess about&n;  the input data type (Z_ASCII or Z_BINARY). In doubt, the data is considered&n;  binary. This field is only for information purposes and does not affect&n;  the compression algorithm in any manner.&n;&n;    deflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input&n;  processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if all input has been&n;  consumed and all output has been produced (only when flush is set to&n;  Z_FINISH), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state was inconsistent (for example&n;  if next_in or next_out was NULL), Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible&n;  (for example avail_in or avail_out was zero).&n;*/

This function must be called&n;   immediately after deflateInit, deflateInit2 or deflateReset, before any&n;   call of deflate. The compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same&n;   dictionary (see inflateSetDictionary).&n;&n;     The dictionary should consist of strings (byte sequences) that are likely&n;   to be encountered later in the data to be compressed, with the most commonly&n;   used strings preferably put towards the end of the dictionary. Using a&n;   dictionary is most useful when the data to be compressed is short and can be&n;   predicted with good accuracy; the data can then be compressed better than&n;   with the default empty dictionary.&n;&n;     Depending on the size of the compression data structures selected by&n;   deflateInit or deflateInit2, a part of the dictionary may in effect be&n;   discarded, for example if the dictionary is larger than the window size in&n;   deflate or deflate2. Thus the strings most likely to be useful should be&n;   put at the end of the dictionary, not at the front.&n;&n;     Upon return of this function, strm-&gt;adler is set to the Adler32 value&n;   of the dictionary; the decompressor may later use this value to determine&n;   which dictionary has been used by the compressor. (The Adler32 value&n;   applies to the whole dictionary even if only a subset of the dictionary is&n;   actually used by the compressor.)&n;&n;     deflateSetDictionary returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if a&n;   parameter is invalid (such as NULL dictionary) or the stream state is&n;   inconsistent (for example if deflate has already been called for this stream&n;   or if the compression method is bsort). deflateSetDictionary does not&n;   perform any compression: this will be done by deflate().&n;*/
