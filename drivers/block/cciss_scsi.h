We also have the block interface,&n;which is where most requests must surely come from, so the upper layer&squot;s&n;notion of how many requests we have outstanding will be wrong most or&n;all of the time. &n;&n;Note, the normal SCSI mid-layer error handling doesn&squot;t work well&n;for this driver because 1) it takes the io_request_lock before&n;calling error handlers and uses a local variable to store flags,&n;so the io_request_lock cannot be released and interrupts enabled&n;inside the error handlers, and, the error handlers cannot poll&n;for command completion because they might get commands from the&n;block half of the driver completing, and not know what to do&n;with them.  That&squot;s what we get for making a hybrid scsi/block&n;driver, I suppose.&n;&n;*/
