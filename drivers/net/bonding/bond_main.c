Based on dummy.c, and eql.c devices.&n; *&n; * bonding.c: an Ethernet Bonding driver&n; *&n; * This is useful to talk to a Cisco EtherChannel compatible equipment:&n; *&t;Cisco 5500&n; *&t;Sun Trunking (Solaris)&n; *&t;Alteon AceDirector Trunks&n; *&t;Linux Bonding&n; *&t;and probably many L2 switches ...&n; *&n; * How it works:&n; *    ifconfig bond0 ipaddress netmask up&n; *      will setup a network device, with an ip address.  No mac address &n; *&t;will be assigned at this time.  The hw mac address will come from &n; *&t;the first slave bonded to the channel.  All slaves will then use &n; *&t;this hw mac address.&n; *&n; *    ifconfig bond0 down&n; *         will release all slaves, marking them as down.&n; *&n; *    ifenslave bond0 eth0&n; *&t;will attach eth0 to bond0 as a slave.  eth0 hw mac address will either&n; *&t;a: be used as initial mac address&n; *&t;b: if a hw mac address already is there, eth0&squot;s hw mac address &n; *&t;   will then be set from bond0.&n; *&n; * v0.1 - first working version.&n; * v0.2 - changed stats to be calculated by summing slaves stats.&n; *&n; * Changes:&n; * Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo &lt;acme@conectiva.com.br&gt;&n; * - fix leaks on failure at bond_init&n; *&n; * 2000/09/30 - Willy Tarreau &lt;willy at meta-x.org&gt;&n; *     - added trivial code to release a slave device.&n; *     - fixed security bug (CAP_NET_ADMIN not checked)&n; *     - implemented MII link monitoring to disable dead links :&n; *       All MII capable slaves are checked every &lt;miimon&gt; milliseconds&n; *       (100 ms seems good). This value can be changed by passing it to&n; *       insmod. A value of zero disables the monitoring (default).&n; *     - fixed an infinite loop in bond_xmit_roundrobin() when there&squot;s no&n; *       good slave.&n; *     - made the code hopefully SMP safe&n; *&n; * 2000/10/03 - Willy Tarreau &lt;willy at meta-x.org&gt;&n; *     - optimized slave lists based on relevant suggestions from Thomas Davis&n; *     - implemented active-backup method to obtain HA with two switches:&n; *       stay as long as possible on the same active interface, while we&n; *       also monitor the backup one (MII link status) because we want to know&n; *       if we are able to switch at any time. ( pass &quot;mode=1&quot; to insmod )&n; *     - lots of stress testings because we need it to be more robust than the&n; *       wires ! :-&gt;&n; *&n; * 2000/10/09 - Willy Tarreau &lt;willy at meta-x.org&gt;&n; *     - added up and down delays after link state change.&n; *     - optimized the slaves chaining so that when we run forward, we never&n; *       repass through the bond itself, but we can find it by searching&n; *       backwards. Renders the deletion more difficult, but accelerates the&n; *       scan.&n; *     - smarter enslaving and releasing.&n; *     - finer and more robust SMP locking&n; *&n; * 2000/10/17 - Willy Tarreau &lt;willy at meta-x.org&gt;&n; *     - fixed two potential SMP race conditions&n; *&n; * 2000/10/18 - Willy Tarreau &lt;willy at meta-x.org&gt;&n; *     - small fixes to the monitoring FSM in case of zero delays&n; * 2000/11/01 - Willy Tarreau &lt;willy at meta-x.org&gt;&n; *     - fixed first slave not automatically used in trunk mode.&n; * 2000/11/10 : spelling of &quot;EtherChannel&quot; corrected.&n; * 2000/11/13 : fixed a race condition in case of concurrent accesses to ioctl().&n; * 2000/12/16 : fixed improper usage of rtnl_exlock_nowait().&n; *&n; * 2001/1/3 - Chad N. Tindel &lt;ctindel at ieee dot org&gt;&n; *     - The bonding driver now simulates MII status monitoring, just like&n; *       a normal network device.  It will show that the link is down iff&n; *       every slave in the bond shows that their links are down.  If at least&n; *       one slave is up, the bond&squot;s MII status will appear as up.&n; *&n; * 2001/2/7 - Chad N. Tindel &lt;ctindel at ieee dot org&gt;&n; *     - Applications can now query the bond from user space to get&n; *       information which may be useful.  They do this by calling&n; *       the BOND_INFO_QUERY ioctl.  Once the app knows how many slaves&n; *       are in the bond, it can call the BOND_SLAVE_INFO_QUERY ioctl to&n; *       get slave specific information (# link failures, etc).  See&n; *       &lt;linux/if_bonding.h&gt; for more details.  The structs of interest&n; *       are ifbond and ifslave.&n; *&n; * 2001/4/5 - Chad N. Tindel &lt;ctindel at ieee dot org&gt;&n; *     - Ported to 2.4 Kernel&n; * &n; * 2001/5/2 - Jeffrey E. Mast &lt;jeff at mastfamily dot com&gt;&n; *     - When a device is detached from a bond, the slave device is no longer&n; *       left thinking that is has a master.&n; *&n; * 2001/5/16 - Jeffrey E. Mast &lt;jeff at mastfamily dot com&gt;&n; *     - memset did not appropriately initialized the bond rw_locks. Used &n; *       rwlock_init to initialize to unlocked state to prevent deadlock when &n; *       first attempting a lock&n; *     - Called SET_MODULE_OWNER for bond device&n; *&n; * 2001/5/17 - Tim Anderson &lt;tsa at mvista.com&gt;&n; *     - 2 paths for releasing for slave release; 1 through ioctl&n; *       and 2) through close. Both paths need to release the same way.&n; *     - the free slave in bond release is changing slave status before&n; *       the free. The netdev_set_master() is intended to change slave state&n; *       so it should not be done as part of the release process.&n; *     - Simple rule for slave state at release: only the active in A/B and&n; *       only one in the trunked case.&n; *&n; * 2001/6/01 - Tim Anderson &lt;tsa at mvista.com&gt;&n; *     - Now call dev_close when releasing a slave so it doesn&squot;t screw up&n; *       out routing table.&n; *&n; * 2001/6/01 - Chad N. Tindel &lt;ctindel at ieee dot org&gt;&n; *     - Added /proc support for getting bond and slave information.&n; *       Information is in /proc/net/&lt;bond device&gt;/info. &n; *     - Changed the locking when calling bond_close to prevent deadlock.&n; *&n; * 2001/8/05 - Janice Girouard &lt;girouard at us.ibm.com&gt;&n; *     - correct problem where refcnt of slave is not incremented in bond_ioctl&n; *       so the system hangs when halting.&n; *     - correct locking problem when unable to malloc in bond_enslave.&n; *     - adding bond_xmit_xor logic.&n; *     - adding multiple bond device support.&n; *&n; * 2001/8/13 - Erik Habbinga &lt;erik_habbinga at hp dot com&gt;&n; *     - correct locking problem with rtnl_exlock_nowait&n; *&n; * 2001/8/23 - Janice Girouard &lt;girouard at us.ibm.com&gt;&n; *     - bzero initial dev_bonds, to correct oops&n; *     - convert SIOCDEVPRIVATE to new MII ioctl calls&n; *&n; * 2001/9/13 - Takao Indoh &lt;indou dot takao at jp dot fujitsu dot com&gt;&n; *     - Add the BOND_CHANGE_ACTIVE ioctl implementation&n; *&n; * 2001/9/14 - Mark Huth &lt;mhuth at mvista dot com&gt;&n; *     - Change MII_LINK_READY to not check for end of auto-negotiation,&n; *       but only for an up link.&n; *&n; * 2001/9/20 - Chad N. Tindel &lt;ctindel at ieee dot org&gt;&n; *     - Add the device field to bonding_t.  Previously the net_device &n; *       corresponding to a bond wasn&squot;t available from the bonding_t &n; *       structure.&n; *&n; * 2001/9/25 - Janice Girouard &lt;girouard at us.ibm.com&gt;&n; *     - add arp_monitor for active backup mode&n; *&n; * 2001/10/23 - Takao Indoh &lt;indou dot takao at jp dot fujitsu dot com&gt;&n; *     - Various memory leak fixes&n; *&n; * 2001/11/5 - Mark Huth &lt;mark dot huth at mvista dot com&gt;&n; *     - Don&squot;t take rtnl lock in bond_mii_monitor as it deadlocks under &n; *       certain hotswap conditions.  &n; *       Note:  this same change may be required in bond_arp_monitor ???&n; *     - Remove possibility of calling bond_sethwaddr with NULL slave_dev ptr &n; *     - Handle hot swap ethernet interface deregistration events to remove&n; *       kernel oops following hot swap of enslaved interface&n; *&n; * 2002/1/2 - Chad N. Tindel &lt;ctindel at ieee dot org&gt;&n; *     - Restore original slave flags at release time.&n; *&n; * 2002/02/18 - Erik Habbinga &lt;erik_habbinga at hp dot com&gt;&n; *     - bond_release(): calling kfree on our_slave after call to&n; *       bond_restore_slave_flags, not before&n; *     - bond_enslave(): saving slave flags into original_flags before&n; *       call to netdev_set_master, so the IFF_SLAVE flag doesn&squot;t end&n; *       up in original_flags&n; *&n; * 2002/04/05 - Mark Smith &lt;mark.smith at comdev dot cc&gt; and&n; *              Steve Mead &lt;steve.mead at comdev dot cc&gt;&n; *     - Port Gleb Natapov&squot;s multicast support patchs from 2.4.12&n; *       to 2.4.18 adding support for multicast.&n; *&n; * 2002/06/10 - Tony Cureington &lt;tony.cureington * hp_com&gt;&n; *     - corrected uninitialized pointer (ifr.ifr_data) in bond_check_dev_link;&n; *       actually changed function to use MIIPHY, then MIIREG, and finally&n; *       ETHTOOL to determine the link status&n; *     - fixed bad ifr_data pointer assignments in bond_ioctl&n; *     - corrected mode 1 being reported as active-backup in bond_get_info;&n; *       also added text to distinguish type of load balancing (rr or xor)&n; *     - change arp_ip_target module param from &quot;1-12s&quot; (array of 12 ptrs)&n; *       to &quot;s&quot; (a single ptr)&n; *&n; * 2002/08/30 - Jay Vosburgh &lt;fubar at us dot ibm dot com&gt;&n; *     - Removed acquisition of xmit_lock in set_multicast_list; caused&n; *       deadlock on SMP (lock is held by caller).&n; *     - Revamped SIOCGMIIPHY, SIOCGMIIREG portion of bond_check_dev_link().&n; *&n; * 2002/09/18 - Jay Vosburgh &lt;fubar at us dot ibm dot com&gt;&n; *     - Fixed up bond_check_dev_link() (and callers): removed some magic&n; *&t; numbers, banished local MII_ defines, wrapped ioctl calls to&n; *&t; prevent EFAULT errors&n; *&n; * 2002/9/30 - Jay Vosburgh &lt;fubar at us dot ibm dot com&gt;&n; *     - make sure the ip target matches the arp_target before saving the&n; *&t; hw address.&n; *&n; * 2002/9/30 - Dan Eisner &lt;eisner at 2robots dot com&gt;&n; *     - make sure my_ip is set before taking down the link, since&n; *&t; not all switches respond if the source ip is not set.&n; *&n; * 2002/10/8 - Janice Girouard &lt;girouard at us dot ibm dot com&gt;&n; *     - read in the local ip address when enslaving a device&n; *     - add primary support&n; *     - make sure 2*arp_interval has passed when a new device&n; *       is brought on-line before taking it down.&n; *&n; * 2002/09/11 - Philippe De Muyter &lt;phdm at macqel dot be&gt;&n; *     - Added bond_xmit_broadcast logic.&n; *     - Added bond_mode() support function.&n; *&n; * 2002/10/26 - Laurent Deniel &lt;laurent.deniel at free.fr&gt;&n; *     - allow to register multicast addresses only on active slave&n; *       (useful in active-backup mode)&n; *     - add multicast module parameter&n; *     - fix deletion of multicast groups after unloading module&n; *&n; * 2002/11/06 - Kameshwara Rayaprolu &lt;kameshwara.rao * wipro_com&gt;&n; *     - Changes to prevent panic from closing the device twice; if we close &n; *       the device in bond_release, we must set the original_flags to down &n; *       so it won&squot;t be closed again by the network layer.&n; *&n; * 2002/11/07 - Tony Cureington &lt;tony.cureington * hp_com&gt;&n; *     - Fix arp_target_hw_addr memory leak&n; *     - Created activebackup_arp_monitor function to handle arp monitoring &n; *       in active backup mode - the bond_arp_monitor had several problems... &n; *       such as allowing slaves to tx arps sequentially without any delay &n; *       for a response&n; *     - Renamed bond_arp_monitor to loadbalance_arp_monitor and re-wrote&n; *       this function to just handle arp monitoring in load-balancing mode;&n; *       it is a lot more compact now&n; *     - Changes to ensure one and only one slave transmits in active-backup &n; *       mode&n; *     - Robustesize parameters; warn users about bad combinations of &n; *       parameters; also if miimon is specified and a network driver does &n; *       not support MII or ETHTOOL, inform the user of this&n; *     - Changes to support link_failure_count when in arp monitoring mode&n; *     - Fix up/down delay reported in /proc&n; *     - Added version; log version; make version available from &quot;modinfo -d&quot;&n; *     - Fixed problem in bond_check_dev_link - if the first IOCTL (SIOCGMIIPH)&n; *&t; failed, the ETHTOOL ioctl never got a chance&n; *&n; * 2002/11/16 - Laurent Deniel &lt;laurent.deniel at free.fr&gt;&n; *     - fix multicast handling in activebackup_arp_monitor&n; *     - remove one unnecessary and confusing current_slave == slave test &n; *&t; in activebackup_arp_monitor&n; *&n; *  2002/11/17 - Laurent Deniel &lt;laurent.deniel at free.fr&gt;&n; *     - fix bond_slave_info_query when slave_id = num_slaves&n; *&n; *  2002/11/19 - Janice Girouard &lt;girouard at us dot ibm dot com&gt;&n; *     - correct ifr_data reference.  Update ifr_data reference&n; *       to mii_ioctl_data struct values to avoid confusion.&n; *&n; *  2002/11/22 - Bert Barbe &lt;bert.barbe at oracle dot com&gt;&n; *      - Add support for multiple arp_ip_target&n; *&n; *  2002/12/13 - Jay Vosburgh &lt;fubar at us dot ibm dot com&gt;&n; *&t;- Changed to allow text strings for mode and multicast, e.g.,&n; *&t;  insmod bonding mode=active-backup.  The numbers still work.&n; *&t;  One change: an invalid choice will cause module load failure,&n; *&t;  rather than the previous behavior of just picking one.&n; *&t;- Minor cleanups; got rid of dup ctype stuff, atoi function&n; * &n; * 2003/02/07 - Jay Vosburgh &lt;fubar at us dot ibm dot com&gt;&n; *&t;- Added use_carrier module parameter that causes miimon to&n; *&t;  use netif_carrier_ok() test instead of MII/ETHTOOL ioctls.&n; *&t;- Minor cleanups; consolidated ioctl calls to one function.&n; *&n; * 2003/02/07 - Tony Cureington &lt;tony.cureington * hp_com&gt;&n; *&t;- Fix bond_mii_monitor() logic error that could result in&n; *&t;  bonding round-robin mode ignoring links after failover/recovery&n; *&n; * 2003/03/17 - Jay Vosburgh &lt;fubar at us dot ibm dot com&gt;&n; *&t;- kmalloc fix (GPF_KERNEL to GPF_ATOMIC) reported by&n; *&t;  Shmulik dot Hen at intel.com.&n; *&t;- Based on discussion on mailing list, changed use of&n; *&t;  update_slave_cnt(), created wrapper functions for adding/removing&n; *&t;  slaves, changed bond_xmit_xor() to check slave_cnt instead of&n; *&t;  checking slave and slave-&gt;dev (which only worked by accident).&n; *&t;- Misc code cleanup: get arp_send() prototype from header file,&n; *&t;  add max_bonds to bonding.txt.&n; *&n; * 2003/03/18 - Tsippy Mendelson &lt;tsippy.mendelson at intel dot com&gt; and&n; *&t;&t;Shmulik Hen &lt;shmulik.hen at intel dot com&gt;&n; *&t;- Make sure only bond_attach_slave() and bond_detach_slave() can&n; *&t;  manipulate the slave list, including slave_cnt, even when in&n; *&t;  bond_release_all().&n; *&t;- Fixed hang in bond_release() with traffic running:&n; *&t;  netdev_set_master() must not be called from within the bond lock.&n; *&n; * 2003/03/18 - Tsippy Mendelson &lt;tsippy.mendelson at intel dot com&gt; and&n; *&t;&t;Shmulik Hen &lt;shmulik.hen at intel dot com&gt;&n; *&t;- Fixed hang in bond_enslave() with traffic running:&n; *&t;  netdev_set_master() must not be called from within the bond lock.&n; *&n; * 2003/03/18 - Amir Noam &lt;amir.noam at intel dot com&gt;&n; *&t;- Added support for getting slave&squot;s speed and duplex via ethtool.&n; *&t;  Needed for 802.3ad and other future modes.&n; *&n; * 2003/03/18 - Tsippy Mendelson &lt;tsippy.mendelson at intel dot com&gt; and&n; *&t;&t;Shmulik Hen &lt;shmulik.hen at intel dot com&gt;&n; *&t;- Enable support of modes that need to use the unique mac address of&n; *&t;  each slave.&n; *&t;  * bond_enslave(): Moved setting the slave&squot;s mac address, and&n; *&t;    openning it, from the application to the driver. This breaks&n; *&t;    backward comaptibility with old versions of ifenslave that open&n; *&t;     the slave before enalsving it !!!.&n; *&t;  * bond_release(): The driver also takes care of closing the slave&n; *&t;    and restoring its original mac address.&n; *&t;- Removed the code that restores all base driver&squot;s flags.&n; *&t;  Flags are automatically restored once all undo stages are done&n; *&t;  properly.&n; *&t;- Block possibility of enslaving before the master is up. This&n; *&t;  prevents putting the system in an unstable state.&n; *&n; * 2003/03/18 - Amir Noam &lt;amir.noam at intel dot com&gt;,&n; *&t;&t;Tsippy Mendelson &lt;tsippy.mendelson at intel dot com&gt; and&n; *&t;&t;Shmulik Hen &lt;shmulik.hen at intel dot com&gt;&n; *    - Added support for IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation mode.&n; *&n; * 2003/05/01 - Amir Noam &lt;amir.noam at intel dot com&gt;&n; *    - Added ABI version control to restore compatibility between&n; *      new/old ifenslave and new/old bonding.&n; *&n; * 2003/05/01 - Shmulik Hen &lt;shmulik.hen at intel dot com&gt;&n; *    - Fixed bug in bond_release_all(): save old value of current_slave&n; *      before setting it to NULL.&n; *    - Changed driver versioning scheme to include version number instead&n; *      of release date (that is already in another field). There are 3&n; *      fields X.Y.Z where:&n; *            X - Major version - big behavior changes&n; *            Y - Minor version - addition of features&n; *            Z - Extra version - minor changes and bug fixes&n; *      The current version is 1.0.0 as a base line.&n; *&n; * 2003/05/01 - Tsippy Mendelson &lt;tsippy.mendelson at intel dot com&gt; and&n; *&t;&t;Amir Noam &lt;amir.noam at intel dot com&gt;&n; *&t;- Added support for lacp_rate module param.&n; *&t;- Code beautification and style changes (mainly in comments).&n; *&t;  new version - 1.0.1&n; *&n; * 2003/05/01 - Shmulik Hen &lt;shmulik.hen at intel dot com&gt;&n; *&t;- Based on discussion on mailing list, changed locking scheme&n; *&t;  to use lock/unlock or lock_bh/unlock_bh appropriately instead&n; *&t;  of lock_irqsave/unlock_irqrestore. The new scheme helps exposing&n; *&t;  hidden bugs and solves system hangs that occurred due to the fact&n; *&t;  that holding lock_irqsave doesn&squot;t prevent softirqs from running.&n; *&t;  This also increases total throughput since interrupts are not&n; *&t;  blocked on each transmitted packets or monitor timeout.&n; *&t;  new version - 2.0.0&n; *&n; * 2003/05/01 - Shmulik Hen &lt;shmulik.hen at intel dot com&gt;&n; *&t;- Added support for Transmit load balancing mode.&n; *&t;- Concentrate all assignments of current_slave to a single point&n; *&t;  so specific modes can take actions when the primary adapter is&n; *&t;  changed.&n; *&t;- Take the updelay parameter into consideration during bond_enslave&n; *&t;  since some adapters loose their link during setting the device.&n; *&t;- Renamed bond_3ad_link_status_changed() to&n; *&t;  bond_3ad_handle_link_change() for compatibility with TLB.&n; *&t;  new version - 2.1.0&n; *&n; * 2003/05/01 - Tsippy Mendelson &lt;tsippy.mendelson at intel dot com&gt;&n; *&t;- Added support for Adaptive load balancing mode which is&n; *&t;  equivalent to Transmit load balancing + Receive load balancing.&n; *&t;  new version - 2.2.0&n; */
